A social network for developers ! </br>
The front part of the app uses Angular framework to run.
The back part of the app uses Java and Spring Boot framework to run.

## **Getting Started**

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

First, get [this repository](https://github.com/Solau92/DevFS-Projet-6-Developpez-une-application-full-stack-complete.git) and import the project on your computer.

* Java 11
* Maven 4.0.0
* MySQL 8.0.31

### **Installing** 

* [Install Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html)
* [Install Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

#### Guides

The following guides illustrate how to use some features concretely:

* [Handling Form Submission](https://spring.io/guides/gs/handling-form-submission/)
* [Serving Web Content with Spring MVC](https://spring.io/guides/gs/serving-web-content/)

### **Running the app** 

Post installation of MySQL, Java and Maven, you must create the database. 

The default name of the database is "mdd", but if you want to change it, modify the *application.properties* file (in the *./back/src/main/resources* folder) and replace "mdd" in the property "spring.datasource.url" by the name you choose for your database.

For demonstration purpose, data will be inserted in the database at the lauching of the app. 

To run the app, go to the folder that contains the pom.xml file (*./back*) and execute the following command in which you have to replace "*%username%*" by your username and "%*password*%" by your password required to access your database : 
 `mvn spring-boot:run "-Dspring-boot.run.arguments=--spring.datasource.username=%username% --spring.datasource.password=%password%"`
